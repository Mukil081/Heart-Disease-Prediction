# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Predicting heart disease using Random Forest:

- Collect and prepare patient data.
- Build a Random Forest model to identify patterns.
- Evaluate model accuracy and interpret results.
- Potentially improve model through hyperparameter tuning.
- Consider deploying the model for real-world use.
